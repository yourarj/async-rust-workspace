    // the following line will not do anything

    // Here is fut is a Future
    // To happen anything this future needs to be run on an executor

    // we can also use .await on any type that implements Future trait
    // PROVIDED the method where are awaiting for compeletion of future
    // must be async too.
    //
    // Unlike block_on(), .await will not block current thread.
    // Instead it'll wait asynchronously waits for completion.
    // This approach allows other tasks to run if current task is not able to progress
    // e.g. as in following example
    watch_favourite_show().await;
    have_favourite_snacks().await;

    // NOTE watching and having snack is synchronous
    // untill you complete watching ðŸŽ¥ the show you can't have snacks ðŸ¥²
